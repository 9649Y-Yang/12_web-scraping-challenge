\
The scraping and analysis tasks are done in the jupyter notebook [mission_to_mars.ipynb](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/12_web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Missions_to_Mars/mission_to_mars.ipynb).\
\
The jupyter notebook is then converting into a  a Python script called [scrape_mars.py] (https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/12_web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Missions_to_Mars/scrape_mars.py). \
\
The flask application which will call scrape function from scrape_mars.py is done in [mars_app.py](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/12_web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Missions_to_Mars/mars_app.py). \
When run this app under python environment, a link will be generated as http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and click to this link will lead to the app page, simply click "Scrape New Data" will give the latest news and images about Mars.
\
The html page can be found in [templates](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/12_web-scraping-challenge/tree/main/Missions_to_Mars/templates) folder, named as [index.html](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/12_web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Missions_to_Mars/templates/index.html).\
\
The final application can be found in [screenshots](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/12_web-scraping-challenge/tree/main/Missions_to_Mars/screenshots) folder.\
